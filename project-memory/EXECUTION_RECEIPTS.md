## RECEIPT-WFG-RECON-20260820-0822
- Task: WFG-RECON-20260820
- Started: 2026-08-20 08:22 Europe/Vienna
- Finished: 2026-08-20 after PR #14 merge and green Project Memory Guard/Quality/Status
- Branch/PR: `automation/reconcile-20260820` / PR #14
- Preflight checked: AGENTS/Project Memory current state, Task Ledger, Started Work, Open Loops, Dependencies, Evidence, Assumptions, Contradictions, Work Locks, current main, open PRs #1/#2, branch-protection state and WellFit V9 cross-repo master.
- Prior attempts found: PR #1 is unrelated product direction; PR #2 is substantive graphical candidate but stale/draft/unaccepted; V9 real-program baseline merged on main.
- Dependency result: graphical work depends on current WellFit-now technical capability and WellFit-Buddy Buddy capability; no cross-repo feature acceptance may be inferred.
- Planned evidence: exact PR/head metadata, live main branch state, current Project Memory, fresh CI on this reconciliation branch.
- Changes made: restored active visual task/loop/lock/evidence/assumption/contradiction records and corrected repository responsibility boundaries.
- Checks/tests: Project Memory Guard, Project Memory Quality and Project Memory Status passed before merge.
- Final diff counterchecked: yes; intended memory-only scope was preserved through merge.
- Regression/security countercheck: fail-closed rule retained: no visual acceptance without fresh current evidence; no direct product push; branch protection gap recorded rather than bypassed.
- Evidence produced: updated Task Ledger, Started Work, Open Loops, Dependencies, Evidence, Assumptions, Contradictions, Work Locks and cross-repo master role wording; PR #14 merged.
- Result status: COUNTERCHECKED
- Open follow-up: reconcile PR #2 and activate branch protection/ruleset through owner UI when available.
- Work lock released: reconciliation task does not own product implementation lock; LOCK-WFG-VIS-001 remains STALE.
- Falsification question: What observation would prove our conclusion wrong? A newer accepted/green visual branch or explicit canonical visual acceptance on another exact revision would require this candidate classification to be superseded.

A receipt is required for meaningful code/config/infra/governance work. A receipt must not contain secrets or protected evidence values.
